## Percival: CNN-WGAN acoustic model for text-to-speech synthesis

<img align="right" width="300" src="./docs/spec_sample.png">

<br/><br/>

Based on Python/TensorFlow/Keras, using Wasserstein GAN and training
regularization to optimise 2D convolutional layers.

It uses [festival](http://festvox.org/festival/) and [Merlin](https://github.com/CSTR-Edinburgh/merlin) scripts to generate
the input text labels. The [PML vocoder](https://github.com/gillesdegottex/pulsemodel) is used for the waveform synthesis.

### Dependencies and working versions

Percival is _not_ a standalone pipeline for TTS. It only trains an acoustic
model. Technically, it is dependent on a text-to-audio alignment system, which
usually provides context input labels (e.g. in HTS format; as `label_state_align`
directory in Merlin).

Dealing with the numerous dependencies between the libraries and tools can also
be a nightmare. We strongly suggest to use a package manager
[conda](https://conda.io/docs/) or [miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html)
on top of the OS package manager. Here are versions that are known to work using
miniconda:

Some packages are not available in conda directly, so install pip in your
conda, activate the environment and then install also:
```
pip install defusedxml bandmat
```
And other version numbers
```
CUDA                      9.0
NVidia Drivers            384.111
```

To apply post-processing for formant enhancement, you need to have `mcep` command line from [SPTK](http://sp-tk.sourceforge.net/)
By default, un-post-processed and post-processed samples are generated in the `out` directory.


### Install and run the demo

First clone the git repository:
```
$ git clone https://gitlab.com/gillesdegottex/percivaltts.git
```
Then, go into the repository directory and compile the various tools neccessary
to run Percival:
```
$ cd percivaltts
$ make build
```

Download the demo data:
```
$ make tests/slt_arctic_merlin_full
```

Go into the `percivaltts` python module directory:
```
$ cd percivaltts
```

Edit `setenv.sh` according to your TensorFlow/Keras installation (see above).

And finally run the demo!
```
$ make run
```

[A web page with the expected demonstration samples can be found here](http://gillesdegottex.eu/Demos/PercivalTTS/compare_percival_0.9.5/)

### Preparing a new voice
Like in Merlin, you basically need the three following elements from any corpus:
* `label_state_align`

    The same directory that is imported in Merlin. It is produced by an
    alignement tool, as in HTS. Merlin provides the necessary scripts for
    generating the text labels from text inputs and align these text labels on
    some given waveform.

    Phone aligned labels can also be used. In this case you have to pass
    `subphone_feats='coarse_coding'` to HTSLabelNormalisation constructor and
    pass `label_type='phone_align'` to `label_normaliser.perform_normalisation`

* `wav`

    The waveforms directory aligned with the labels above

* `file_id_list.scp`

    The same file that you find in Merlin, which contains the basenames of each
    file in `label_state_align` and `wav`.    

Put this somehwere in a common directory and point the `cp` variable in the
`run.py` file to this directory.


### Formats

The are a few assumptions across the code about data formats.

First, floating point precision values are always saved on disc using the `float32` format.

#### Data set
The basenames of the corpus files are listed in a file (e.g. file_id_list.scp).
This list is then split into [traning; validation; test] sets, always in this order.
The validation start starts at `id_valid_start` and contains `id_valid_nb` files.
The test set directly follows the validation set and contains `id_test_nb`.

Because the size of the training set is always an interger multiple of the batch size, the training set might have less than `id_valid_start` files.
The `id_valid_start-1` last files right before `id_valid_start` might thus be completely ignored by the training process.

A last set exists, the demo set, which is a subset of the test set. This is convenient for generating and listening quickly to a few known sentences after a training. By default it is the first 10 sentences of the test set.
`id_test_demostart` can be used to select the starting index (relative to the test set) in order to chose where the demo set starts within the test set.

During training, percival uses batches that have a small time window (2sec by default). Thus, when a sentences is picked for training, only this time window is used.
There is two main advantage of this data formating: i) the memory size on the GPU is dependent on the duration of this time window and not on the random selection of the sentences; ii) each batch is full, in the sense that it doesn't need any zero padding at the end of short sentences, which means that masks are neither necessary.
However, an epoch is not a full epoch in the sense that it does _not_ see all of the training data. This explains why the number of "epoch" is quite huge (300) by default in order to compensate for the unseen data.

#### File access and shapes
To represent multiple files in a directory, file paths are usually defined with a wildcard (e.g. `waveforms/*.wav`).
Because input and output data of the network (lab and cmp files) are saved in raw `float32` format, without header, it is not possible to know the actual dimensions of the data
inside each file.
In Percival, the trick is to specify the shape of the data as a suffix of the file path, e.g. `spectrum/*.spec:(-1,129)`. this suffix will be used, as is, to reshape the numpy array using `np.reshape(.)`.

#### Batches

A batch has a shape: [size, length, features_dim], that represent the number of samples in the batches, the number of time frames in the batch and the feature dimensionality, respectively. Because TensorFlow/Keras needs a "channel" dimension (as in pictures), batches' shape often become temporarily [size, 1, length, features_dim] so that the last two dimensions define a picture of size [length, features_dim].

#### Features order

The implementation of the models assume the following features order: f0, amplitude spectrum (spec), noise (e.g. aperiodicity noise mask), vuv.

### Results repeatability

The seed of the random number generator is forced by default.
In order to have non-deterministic runs, replace the content of the function `numpy_force_random_seed` in utils.py by `pass`
https://keras.io/getting-started/faq/#how-can-i-obtain-reproducible-results-using-keras-during-development

When the seed is forced, and while using the CPU, all training runs are supposed to output the exact same numerical results, no matter the model.

When using the GPU, the runs are usually NOT repeatable and thus output different results.


### Training optimisation

Even though WGAN is more robust than the original GAN, there are still a few elements to verify to be sure a training went well.
1) The `discri_training` has to be higher than zero. If it goes negative, it surely means the either the critic or the generator converges too fast.
2) `model_training_wgan_lse_ratio` is the ratio between the WGAN loss and the LSE loss. If it goes very close to zero, it means the LSE loss is drowning the WGAN loss. In such a case, you  might want to decrease `cfg.train_LScoef` closer to zero.
3) if `discri_validation` doesn't decrease overall over the end of your training, it might be that you should run your training longer.


### Cloning

Managing multiple experiments in parallel, fixing bugs and try new ideas while keeping track of all the changes this can imply can become quite problematic. In Percival, there is a simple script `clone.sh` that allows you to clone the whole code source and place it in an experiment directory:
```
$ ./clone.sh /path/to/experiment1
```
or clone and run the `run.py` script file directly:
```
$ ./clone.sh /path/to/experiment1 bash ../percivaltts/setenv.sh python ../percivaltts/run.py
```
when a script is runned using `clone.sh`, the working directory is `/path/to/experiment1/out` so that all of the experiment results are in this `out` sub-directory and all the code is in a separate sub-directory `percivaltts`.
You can also replace the `bash` command by a script for submitting the job to a Sun Grid Engine (SGE).
The `Makefile` has also all the corresponding commands (clone, run, clone_run_grid, etc.)
